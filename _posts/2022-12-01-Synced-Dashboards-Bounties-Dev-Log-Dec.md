### Aims for December 2022
- Release dashboards on Development web app
- Learn Rust and Soroban
- Write a simple DAO contract test



### Progress (will be updated as we go)
- Figured out how to merge dashboards into main product while allowing old and new versions to co-exist
- Read Rust book, now comfortable in Rust.
    - Turns out Soroban smart contracts make very little use of Rust, way less complicated than Rust.
