**Naked Streets: Do They Bring Chaos or Safety?**

_What's happening to the cities choosing to remove road signs, traffic lights, and markings? Apparently, they're safer._

Road rage is, simply put, a phenomena that is _so_ universal, that it makes me wonder if we would even survive without it. I've travelled to dozens of countries, to almost every continent, and I've seen even the most seemingly basic elements of day-to-day life completely turned upside down. But for all the variation in lifestyle and cultures, road rage persists. Everywhere.

People have tried all sorts of ways to manage traffic. From instituting neighbourhood watch areas, to road cameras, to traffic lights, to speed limits, to more lights, to ramps and pedestrians crossing, to road signs, to public awareness campaigns, to _more_ lights, and the list goes on and on.

Now, people in cities around Europe are trying a wholly different approach: _getting rid of these signs all together_. Not just signs, getting rid of everything. Traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, even the distinction between roads for cars and pavements for pedestrians.

Imagine the busiest, messiest crossroads you know. The one that just makes you sigh if you have to drive through it, shout as you drive through, and shudder if you walk past. Imagine all the lights and signs removed from that crossing. What would happen? That's what cities around the continent are trying.

Sound chaotic? Surprisingly, it's not. Everywhere that's implemented the so-called _naked streets_ has seen decreases in traffic accidents, and increases in the smooth flow of traffic. Here's a closer look:

**Who stripped the streets?**

The concept of the naked street is usually attributed to Hans Monderman, a Dutch road traffic engineer. Moderman didn't like the way the government controlled a space that should be ours. By imposing travel restrictions, he felt they were restricting our rights and freedoms as well.

Instead, he envisaged a different way to conceptualise traffic as part of the spatial fabric of our lives. Instead of regulation and segregation, Monderman believed that we could allow people — drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians — to communicate with each other to negotiate their space, including who gets to pass where and when.

**Why would anybody want to do that?**

The philosophy behind the naked street is that it is essentially a shared space.

The space where we live, walk, drive, or cycle is shared by all of us, and is essentially ours. With that in mind, there are 2 main principles:

1. Our space shouldn't be controlled by the state: we should have the autonomy to manoeuvre our space in the way that we see is best
2. In the spirit of sharing, we should communicate with each other to determine how we share our space

It sounds very different to the uber-organised world we're used to living in. A lot of us are used to think that regulation is necessary so we can have order.

Shared spaces reject that. They want to have as little demarcation as possible between vehicles and pedestrians.

**How has it worked out?**

All the spaces that have implemented naked streets have seen reductions in the speed of vehicles, reductions in road accidents, and reductions in pedestrian incidents. As well as that, they've seen increases in the smooth flow of traffic.

**Take, for example, what happened in Poynton, a village-like town in Cheshire, England.**

*[&quot;_Park Lane (Poynton High Street), Cheshire&quot;](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41616459@N02/11926246975) by [The Academy of Urbanism](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41616459@N02)*

In Poynton, there was a busy intersection which connected the town to the highway and other nearby towns. It was notoriously busy — a site of traffic jams, accidents, and of course: road rage. Lots of it.

*Before the renovations. Notice how there are still suggestive sidewalks in the new design, but the restrictions have been massively reduced. [&quot;Park Lane, Poynton&quot;](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/67572) by [L J Cunningham](https://geograph.org.uk/profile/1755)*

In a daring project, the Council decided to experiment with making the intersection into a shared space. They removed barriers between pedestrians and cars, removed traffic lights, removed pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes, and made the square into a shared, open, naked street.

The results were quite outstanding. Traffic got by a lot quicker. Pedestrians felt safer crossing the streets. Accidents decreased sharply.

Some residents, understandably, had initially opposed the plans. But, once the new square opened, they were amazed by the results.

**Or, take the example of London's Exhibition Road.**

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-05-Naked-Streets-7.jpg)
*[&quot;IMGP8936&quot;](https://www.flickr.com/photos/23136508@N00/16045947546) by [mattbuck4950](https://www.flickr.com/photos/23136508@N00)*

The situation with London's Exhibition Road is a bit different. Exhibition Road, aptly named, is central to London's cultural hotspots: it leads to the Royal Albert Hall on one end and is bordered by the Victoria and Albert Museum on one side, and Imperial College and the Science and History Museums on the other. Collectively, these attractions bring in more annual visitors than Venice does.

You'd think that a road like that, so central to London's cultural identity and tourism, would be nothing less than red-carpet-like. But, it had been largely neglected for years. It was notorious for traffic jams, difficult pedestrian crossings, and the impossibility of finding a parking spot. Its overall appearance and atmosphere probably did more to contribute to the stereotype of England being grey and gloomy than it did to welcome visitors and highlight its cultural attributes.

That's why, when it came time to sit down and discuss renovations, it wasn't just ease of access that was on the table. The designers of the new Exhibition Road wanted something to make traffic control easier, yes, but that's not all they wanted. They also wanted Exhibition Road to live up to its symbolic position and cultural importance. They wanted it to invite people in and to emphasise the shared and central value of the place.

Hence: Bring in the naked streets.

Barriers between pedestrians and cars were, as with Poynton Square, removed. There are some suggestive guidelines for parking spots, but otherwise, pedestrians, cars, and cyclists have the freedom to navigate however they please, and to negotiate with one another to share the space.

The results were quite remarkable. The renovations didn't just improve the flow of traffic, they also improved the pedestrian experience, and highlighted the Road as an attraction in and of itself, rather than merely being a thoroughfare.

**Another nice example is Elwick Square in Kent, England.**

Elwick Square, in Ashford, also tested out the naked streets. They've given no priority to cyclists, pedestrians, or motorists. Some cars do u-turns, others stop on the sides, but there are no signs indicating what they should or shouldn't do.

Some pedestrians have said they feel a bit hesitant when crossing. But the numbers show that accidents have drastically gone down. Motorists and pedestrians make eye-contact with each other to manoeuvre their way around the space which, in theory, should encourage a sense of community.

**Where do we go from here?**

Are naked streets the future?

Well, it's probably too soon to tell. Yes, they've worked well in numerous places, but there's also been concern from citizens. In all likelihood, some experimentation is still needed to see how and where naked streets can work best, to better manage our spatial communities.

In terms of accountability, having rules and regulations probably makes it easier when accidents happen, to find out who was in the wrong. But, even that is based on what we're used to with the legal system handling regulated streets. A shift to more naked streets would also require a shift in how driving lessons are taught in the first place, and on how the laws surrounding the streets are shaped and applied.

**When did they really start?**

A note on controversy:

The idea of naked streets has generated some backlash. Not over the concept, but over its attribution.

Some critics argue that naked streets have been around for a long time outside European contexts. In some places, it's the norm not to have road signs and regulations, and people are comfortable sharing their streets that way.

These critics are basically saying that advocates of naked streets have taken something that already exists, and re-packaged it as a European invention.

In all fairness, this is likely true. But people implementing naked streets now aren't making claims on originality — they're interested in moving towards a new approach of conceptualising and organising our public spaces. And that's pretty cool for all of us.
