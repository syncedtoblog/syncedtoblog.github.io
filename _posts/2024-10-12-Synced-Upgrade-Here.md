### What's in the new Synced?
Some big (and many little) changes elevate your exploring experience, including:

- **Dashboards** - You can create dashboards to follow regions of interest. Dashboards gather
  marks that you and others leave in the region along with other regional updates.

- **Geo-bounties (private beta)** - Want specific kinds of information on your dashboards? You will be able to 
  issue geo-bounties to other Synced users for collecting data of interest. And you'll be 
  able to earn paid-bounties for gathering information others would like. (**get in touch to trial these**)

- **A new interface** - Our new interface is based on your feedback and you'll find it significantly 
  easier to use.

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** - Web technology has moved on the point where we found we could implement the above 
  as well with web apps as we could with native mobile apps. You can also now install apps directly from the web with PWA technology.



### How to install it
The old Synced apps have ceased to function and will no longer be available in the app stores. The new Synced is now installable via the web itself! To upgrade:

- Uninstall your existing Synced app if you have it installed.
- Visit the Synced [homepage](https://synced.to) in your mobile browser.
- On Android (Chrome), go to the menu and select "Add to Home Screen".
- On iOS (Safari), tap the "Share" icon, and select "Add to Home Screen".
- Click on the icon to open the app, login and you'll find all your existing marks nestled in a shiny new user interface.


<3 for your continued support!
